# Network-based-Intrusion-Detection-System
The case study on a Network-based Intrusion Detection System is a Machine Learning-based Web application based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02460.pdf research paper. I have performed both binary and multi-class classification to predict the presence of any intrusion-based signal. If present, then which type of signal is present in the network.    I have used various techniques like under sampling and over sampling because of the imbalances in the dataset, then train the model using Machine Learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  Lastly built a web application and deploy it to AWS using AWS EC2 instance
